# Python - Introduction (Class 1, Quarter 3 - GIAIC)

## Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Pythonâ€™s design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Who Invented Python?
Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and was officially released in 1991. He designed Python to be an easy-to-read language that removes unnecessary complexity, unlike other programming languages of that time.

## How Was Python Invented?
- Guido van Rossum was working at the **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)** in the Netherlands.
- He was inspired by the **ABC programming language**, which aimed to be simple but powerful.
- He developed Python as an open-source language and released **Python 1.0** in 1991.
- Over the years, Python has evolved with multiple versions, including Python 2 and the currently widely used **Python 3**.

## Features of Python
1. **Easy to Learn and Use** â€“ Python has a simple syntax similar to English.
2. **Interpreted Language** â€“ Python does not require compilation; it runs directly via an interpreter.
3. **Dynamically Typed** â€“ Variable types are assigned automatically at runtime.
4. **Object-Oriented** â€“ Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms.
5. **Extensive Libraries** â€“ Comes with a rich set of built-in libraries for various applications.
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** â€“ Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
7. **Highly Scalable** â€“ Used for small scripts as well as large-scale applications.
8. **Community Support** â€“ Has a large and active developer community.

## Basic Python Syntax
```python
# Printing a message
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Data Types
name = "Python"
age = 30
pi = 3.14
is_cool = True

# Conditional Statements
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Functions
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))
```

## Applications of Python
- **Web Development** â€“ Frameworks like Django and Flask.
- **Data Science** â€“ Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning & AI** â€“ TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
- **Automation & Scripting** â€“ Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Game Development** â€“ Pygame for creating simple games.
- **Cybersecurity** â€“ Used in ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** â€“ Python supports IoT applications.
