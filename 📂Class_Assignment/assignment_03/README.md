## Control Flow & Loops

**Key Concepts:**  
- `if-else` statements, `for` loops, and conditional logic.

**Examples:**  
1. **Voting Eligibility Check**: Uses `if-else` to determine voting eligibility based on age.
2. **Grade Assignment**: Uses `if-elif-else` inside a loop to assign grades to scores.
3. **Simple Loop**: Iterates 5 times with `range()`.

## Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries

### Lists
- **Mutable**, ordered collections.
- **Examples**: Create, access, and modify items.

### Tuples
- **Immutable**, ordered collections.
- **Examples**: Create and access items.

### Dictionaries
- **Key-value pairs**, mutable, and unordered.
- **Examples**: Create, access values by keys.

---

## Sets & Frozensets

### Sets
- **Unique**, unordered, mutable elements.
- **Operations**: Add (`add()`), remove (`discard()`), and more.

### Frozensets
- **Immutable** version of sets.
- **Operations**: Cannot be modified after creation.
